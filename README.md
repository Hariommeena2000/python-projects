# python-projects
Welcome to Python project.
it is a simple python project by using built in library numpy and using oops(class and objects) concept, Where we can manipulate the student data with two subjects marks. Here we can add, delete, search or display the whole students by using different function. 
in this project i create one class name as student and its (__init__)constructor in which self is a parameter to assign values.
we take four arguments like Name, Rollno., Marks1 and Marks2.
we define a "addstudent" function to add new students.
we define a "display" function  to display all the students present in the student class.
we define a "search" function to search a particular student by its roll no.
we define a "delete" function to delete a particular student by its roll no.
we define a "update" function to update a particular student by its roll no.
